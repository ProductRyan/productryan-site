<h1>Muses</h1>
At Campus Labs we support higher education's mission of improving our society through technology and consulting. As we iterate and improve our practices and products we draw on many sources of inspiration in order to guide us forward.
<h2>Internal Muses</h2>
<ul>
	<li>our cadre of experienced higher education consultants</li>
	<li>our innovative product development teams</li>
	<li>our members</li>
	<li>data from the usage of our products and services</li>
</ul>
<h2>External Muses</h2>
<ul>
	<li>preeminent research and commentary in the areas of our focus</li>
	<li>new and creative uses of technology being explored by other industries and domains</li>
	<li>emerging trends from the front lines of higher education institutional management</li>
	<li>partnerships with leading education associations and think-tanks</li>
</ul>
On a daily basis, we receive new inspiration from our muses which influence our current work, as-well-as our plans for the future. Each time we consider a new idea we validate it against our mission:
<blockquote>Campus Labs strives to empower higher education through the strategic use of data.

We are inspired to help campuses leverage their data ecosystem to develop insight, identify opportunities, and enable institutional improvement.

We aspire to be more than just a great company, but an organization that transforms higher education.</blockquote>
Because our consulting and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" target="_blank">software services</a> are malleable there is always an opportunity... and temptation... to act immediately on good ideas. However, there is rarely enough time to incorporate all of the new good ideas into our offerings without sacrificing the current good idea that we are working on bringing to our members in sophisticated and clever ways.

An unfortunate truth is that we will never be able to incorporate all of our muses' good ideas into our offering in a way that is sensitive to the cost demands of higher education. It is also true that sometimes just because an idea is good, it doesn't mean that it helps move the needle on the vision that higher education has for itself and its learners. We try our best to curate the ideas that we receive in a responsible way that maximizes their impact with the majority of our members in order to make a greater impact on higher education.
<h1>The Journey of an Idea</h1>
Once we receive an idea from one of our muses our product management or consulting team begins to consider it in-line with the current priorities of our work. If the idea fits and improves upon our immediate work, it is considered against our internal business evaluation process, and then either incorporated into our work or determined to be out-of-scope.

If an idea is about an area of our offering that is currently not under iteration it is reviewed by our product or consulting leadership during periodic idea reviews, which inform strategic planning discussions and prioritization. If there are several good ideas about a particular area of our offerings, we tend to prioritize that area higher.

By collecting good ideas over time, we get a sense of the trending, and sometimes conflicting, sentiment of our muses; enabling us to uncover the right strategic direction in an emerging or contentious area.

During times of rapid iteration we focus our attention to the areas of our offering that we are currently working on to ensure that we produce high-quality work.

For these reasons, (1) an interest in trends over time and (2) focus on the work in front of us, we usually do not engage in conversation or in status updates with our muses when an idea is presented.
<h1>Share your Idea</h1>
Thank you for being a thoughtful contributor to our work. We love to hear from members and others interested in helping us serve higher education in better ways. Your idea means a lot to us and we appreciate the time that you spend on helping us understand it.

Ideas are reviewed periodically by our product and consulting leadership as we plan for the future of our offering. We collect many ideas over time and periodically review them as a collection in order to identify trends, patterns, and sentiment.

If your idea lines up with an area of our offering that is currently under iteration we may have some follow-up questions for you right-away.

If you think you've found a flaw in our software, please contact our <a href="https://campuslabs.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">support team</a> who will track down the issue and help you get a resolution ASAP.
